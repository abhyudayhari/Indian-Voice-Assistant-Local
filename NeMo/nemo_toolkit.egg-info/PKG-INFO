## Introduction

NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a scalable and cloud-native generative AI
framework built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Large
Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV)
domains. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and
deploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and
pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).

## LLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization

All NeMo models are trained with
[Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning). Training is
automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs.

When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training
techniques, incorporating [parallelism
strategies](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modeloverview.html)
to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques
include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully
Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed
Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.

NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize [NVIDIA Transformer
Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) for FP8 training on
NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging [NVIDIA Megatron
Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) for
scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM,
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF). See [NVIDIA NeMo
Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner) for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the
latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA,
P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/sft_peft/index.html)
for the full list of supported models and techniques.

## LLMs and MMs Deployment and Optimization

NeMo LLMs and MMs can be deployed and optimized with [NVIDIA NeMo
Microservices](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access).

## Speech AI

NeMo ASR and TTS models can be optimized for inference and deployed for
production use cases with [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva).

## NeMo Framework Launcher

[NeMo Framework
Launcher](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher) is a
cloud-native tool that streamlines the NeMo Framework experience. It is
used for launching end-to-end NeMo Framework training jobs on CSPs and
Slurm clusters.

The NeMo Framework Launcher includes extensive recipes, scripts,
utilities, and documentation for training NeMo LLMs. It also includes
the NeMo Framework [Autoconfigurator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher#53-using-autoconfigurator-to-find-the-optimal-configuration),
which is designed to find the optimal model parallel configuration for
training on a specific cluster.

To get started quickly with the NeMo Framework Launcher, please see the
[NeMo Framework
Playbooks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).
The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS
training, but it will soon.

## Get Started with NeMo Framework

Getting started with NeMo Framework is easy. State-of-the-art pretrained
NeMo models are freely available on [Hugging Face
Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=nemo&sort=downloads&search=nvidia)
and [NVIDIA
NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC).
These models can be used to generate text or images, transcribe audio,
and synthesize speech in just a few lines of code.

We have extensive
[tutorials](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/starthere/tutorials.html)
that can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or
with our [NGC NeMo Framework
Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo).
We also have
[playbooks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html)
for users who want to train NeMo models with the NeMo Framework
Launcher.

## Install NeMo Framework

The NeMo Framework can be installed in a variety of ways, depending on
your needs. Depending on the domain, you may find one of the following
installation methods more suitable.

- Conda / Pip - Refer to [Conda](#conda) and [Pip](#pip) for
  installation instructions.
  - This is the recommended method for ASR and TTS domains.
  - When using a Nvidia PyTorch container as the base, this is the
      recommended method for all domains.
- Docker Containers - Refer to [Docker containers](#docker-containers)
  for installation instructions.
  - NeMo Framework container -
      [nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05]{.title-ref}
- LLMs and MMs Dependencies - Refer to [LLMs and MMs
    Dependencies](#install-llms-and-mms-dependencies) for installation
    instructions.

**Important: We strongly recommended that you start with a base NVIDIA
PyTorch container: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.02-py3.**

### Conda

Install NeMo in a fresh Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name nemo python==3.10.12
conda activate nemo
```

Install PyTorch using their
[configurator](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/):

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

The command to install PyTorch may depend on your system. Use the
configurator linked above to find the right command for your system.

Then, install NeMo via Pip or from Source. We do not provide NeMo on the
conda-forge or any other Conda channel.

### Pip

To install the nemo_toolkit, use the following installation method:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
pip install Cython packaging
pip install nemo_toolkit['all']
```

Depending on the shell used, you may need to use the
`"nemo_toolkit[all]"` specifier instead in the above command.

### Pip from a Specific Domain

To install a specific domain of NeMo, you must first install the
nemo_toolkit using the instructions listed above. Then, you run the
following domain-specific commands:

```bash
pip install nemo_toolkit['asr']
pip install nemo_toolkit['nlp']
pip install nemo_toolkit['tts']
pip install nemo_toolkit['vision']
pip install nemo_toolkit['multimodal']
```

### Pip from a Source Branch

If you want to work with a specific version of NeMo from a particular
GitHub branch (e.g main), use the following installation method:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
pip install Cython packaging
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git@{BRANCH}#egg=nemo_toolkit[all]
```

### Build from Source

If you want to clone the NeMo GitHub repository and contribute to NeMo
open-source development work, use the following installation method:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
./reinstall.sh
```

If you only want the toolkit without the additional Conda-based
dependencies, you can replace `reinstall.sh` with `pip install -e .`
when your PWD is the root of the NeMo repository.

### Mac Computers with Apple Silicon

To install NeMo on Mac computers with the Apple M-Series GPU, you need
to create a new Conda environment, install PyTorch 2.0 or higher, and
then install the nemo_toolkit.

**Important: This method is only applicable to the ASR domain.**

Run the following code:

```shell
# [optional] install mecab using Homebrew, to use sacrebleu for NLP collection
# you can install Homebrew here: https://brew.sh
brew install mecab

# [optional] install pynini using Conda, to use text normalization
conda install -c conda-forge pynini

# install Cython manually
pip install cython packaging

# clone the repo and install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
pip install 'nemo_toolkit[all]'

# Note that only the ASR toolkit is guaranteed to work on MacBook - so for MacBook use pip install 'nemo_toolkit[asr]'
```

### Windows Computers

To install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), run the following code
in PowerShell:

```shell
wsl --install
# [note] If you run wsl --install and see the WSL help text, it means WSL is already installed.
```

To learn more about installing WSL, refer to [Microsoft\'s official
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

After installing your Linux distribution with WSL, two options are
available:

**Option 1:** Open the distribution (Ubuntu by default) from the Start
menu and follow the instructions.

**Option 2:** Launch the Terminal application. Download it from
[Microsoft\'s Windows Terminal
page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal) if not
installed.

Next, follow the instructions for Linux systems, as provided above. For
example:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
./reinstall.sh
```

### RNNT

For optimal performance of a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNNT),
install the Numba package from Conda.

Run the following code:

```bash
conda remove numba
pip uninstall numba
conda install -c conda-forge numba
```

## Install LLMs and MMs Dependencies

If you work with the LLM and MM domains, three additional dependencies
are required: NVIDIA Apex, NVIDIA Transformer Engine, and NVIDIA
Megatron Core. When working with the [main]{.title-ref} branch, these
dependencies may require a recent commit.

The most recent working versions of these dependencies are here:

```bash
export apex_commit=810ffae374a2b9cb4b5c5e28eaeca7d7998fca0c
export te_commit=bfe21c3d68b0a9951e5716fb520045db53419c5e
export mcore_commit=02871b4df8c69fac687ab6676c4246e936ce92d0
export nv_pytorch_tag=24.02-py3
```

When using a released version of NeMo, please refer to the [Software
Component
Versions](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/softwarecomponentversions.html)
for the correct versions.

### PyTorch Container

We recommended that you start with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container:
nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.02-py3.

If starting with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container, you must first launch
the container:

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --shm-size=16g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:$nv_pytorch_tag
```

Next, you need to install the dependencies.

### Apex

NVIDIA Apex is required for LLM and MM domains. Although Apex is
pre-installed in the NVIDIA PyTorch container, you may need to update it
to a newer version.

To install Apex, run the following code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
cd apex
git checkout $apex_commit
pip install . -v --no-build-isolation --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext --cuda_ext --fast_layer_norm --distributed_adam --deprecated_fused_adam --group_norm"
```

When attempting to install Apex separately from the NVIDIA PyTorch
container, you might encounter an error if the CUDA version on your
system is different from the one used to compile PyTorch. To bypass this
error, you can comment out the relevant line in the setup file located
in the Apex repository on GitHub here:
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/blob/master/setup.py#L32>.

cuda-nvprof is needed to install Apex. The version should match the CUDA
version that you are using.

To install cuda-nvprof, run the following code:

```bash
conda install -c nvidia cuda-nvprof=11.8
```

Finally, install the packaging:

```bash
pip install packaging
```

To install the most recent versions of Apex locally, it might be
necessary to remove the [pyproject.toml]{.title-ref} file from the Apex
directory.

### Transformer Engine

NVIDIA Transformer Engine is required for LLM and MM domains. Although
the Transformer Engine is pre-installed in the NVIDIA PyTorch container,
you may need to update it to a newer version.

The Transformer Engine facilitates training with FP8 precision on NVIDIA
Hopper GPUs and introduces many enhancements for the training of
Transformer-based models. Refer to [Transformer Engine](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/installation.html)
for information.

To install Transformer Engine, run the following code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git && \
cd TransformerEngine && \
git checkout $te_commit && \
git submodule init && git submodule update && \
NVTE_FRAMEWORK=pytorch NVTE_WITH_USERBUFFERS=1 MPI_HOME=/usr/local/mpi pip install .
```

Transformer Engine requires PyTorch to be built with at least CUDA 11.8.

### Megatron Core

Megatron Core is required for LLM and MM domains. Megatron Core is a
library for scaling large Transformer-based models. NeMo LLMs and MMs
leverage Megatron Core for model parallelism, transformer architectures,
and optimized PyTorch datasets.

To install Megatron Core, run the following code:

```bash

## NeMo Text Processing

NeMo Text Processing, specifically Inverse Text Normalization, is now a
separate repository. It is located here:
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing>.

## Docker Containers

NeMo containers are launched concurrently with NeMo version updates.
NeMo Framework now supports LLMs, MMs, ASR, and TTS in a single
consolidated Docker container. You can find additional information about
released containers on the [NeMo releases
page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases).

To use a pre-built container, run the following code:

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05
```

To build a nemo container with Dockerfile from a branch, run the
following code:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile -t nemo:latest
```

If you choose to work with the main branch, we recommend using NVIDIA\'s
PyTorch container version 23.10-py3 and then installing from GitHub.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v <nemo_github_folder>:/NeMo --shm-size=8g \
-p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit \
stack=67108864 --device=/dev/snd nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.10-py3
```

## Future Work

The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS
training, but it will soon.
